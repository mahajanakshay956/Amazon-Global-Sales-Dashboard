# Amazon-Global-Sales-Dashboard
🚀 Project Overview
The Amazon Sales Dashboard helps stakeholders track and analyze sales data over time. It provides valuable insights into revenue trends, top-performing products, customer segments, and regional sales distribution.

🧾 Dataset Description
The dataset used for this Power BI project consists of transactional-level sales data simulating Amazon’s retail performance. It includes detailed records of each order, such as the unique Order ID, Order Date, and product-specific information like Product Category, Sub-Category, and Product Name. Sales performance is captured through columns like Units Sold, Unit Price, Total Sales, and Profit. Additional attributes such as Region and Customer Segment provide context for analyzing sales trends across geographical locations and different types of buyers (e.g., Consumer, Corporate, and Home Office). Shipping-related costs are also included via the Shipping Cost field, enabling a more in-depth profitability analysis. This dataset was either sourced from publicly available repositories or generated for the purpose of building and demonstrating the dashboard's functionality.

📂 Note: The dataset is either publicly available or simulated for demonstration purposes.
